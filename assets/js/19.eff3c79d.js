I am encountering the term more and more often, and I'm wondering if it is only about plain classes or it means something more?\n\nAnswer:\n\n\"Plain Old C# Object\"\n\nJust a normal class, no attributes describing infrastructure concerns or other responsibilities that your domain objects shouldn't have.\n\nEDIT - as other answers have stated, it is technically \"Plain Old CLR Object\" but I, like David Arno comments, prefer \"Plain Old Class Object\" to avoid ties to specific languages or technologies.\n\nTO CLARIFY: In other words, they don’t derive from some special base class, nor do they return any special types for their properties.\n\n============================\n\nMost people have said it - Plain Old CLR Object (as opposed to the earlier POJO - Plain Old Java Object)\n\nThe POJO one came out of EJB, which required you to inherit from a specific parent class for things like value objects (what you get back from a query in an ORM or similar), so if you ever wanted to move from EJB (eg to Spring), you were stuffed.\n\nPOJO's are just classes which dont force inheritance or any attribute markup to make them \"work\" in whatever framework you are using.\n\nPOCO's are the same, except in .NET.\n\nGenerally it'll be used around ORM's - older (and some current ones) require you to inherit from a specific base class, which ties you to that product. Newer ones dont (nhibernate being the variant I know) - you just make a class, register it with the ORM, and you are off. Much easier.\n")])])]),t("p",[t("img",{attrs:{src:s(524),alt:"image-20210708163604803"}})])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=a.exports}}]);
